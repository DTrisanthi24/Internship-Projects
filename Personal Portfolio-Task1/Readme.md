~ Personal Portfolio Webpage
🔹 Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio webpage built using pure HTML.
It highlights my profile, technical skills, and provides a contact form for professional outreach.
The webpage is designed with a clean, semantic structure and serves as a digital introduction for recruiters, collaborators, and internship reviewers.

This project is part of my Web Development Internship at The Developers Arena (Jan 10 – Apr 6, 2026), where I complete 12 weekly tasks focused on front‑end development.

🔹 Objectives
Create a simple, accessible, and semantic HTML webpage.

Showcase career goals and technical skills.

Provide a working contact form using Formspree integration.

Document the project professionally for recruiters and collaborators.

🔹 Setup & Installation Instructions
Clone or download the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-webpage.git
Open the HTML file

Navigate to the project folder

Double‑click index.html or open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Optional: Preview with local server

bash
npx http-server
Visit http://localhost:8080 to view your site.

Formspree Setup

Replace yourFormID in the form action URL with your actual Formspree ID

This enables the contact form to send messages to your email

🔹 Code Structure
Code
index.html         # Main HTML file
└── <header>       # Title, profile image, navigation links
└── <main>         # Content sections
    ├── <section id="about">     # About Me description
    ├── <section id="skills">    # Skills listed in <ul>
    └── <section id="contact">   # Contact form with inputs
└── <footer>       # Copyright and branding

🔹 Technical Requirements Met
✅ Semantic HTML5 → Used <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer> for clear structure

✅ Accessibility → Added alt text for images, labels for form inputs, and required attributes

✅ Responsive Basics → Layout adapts to different screen sizes using relative sizing

✅ Form Integration → Contact form connected to Formspree for message handling

✅ Clean Code Practices → Organized sections, indentation, and comments for readability

🔹 Challenges Faced
Handling image path issues (absolute vs. relative) to ensure portability.

Configuring Formspree integration correctly for the contact form.

Maintaining readability and accessibility using only HTML without CSS or JavaScript.

Writing clear and concise documentation for recruiters and collaborators.

🔹 Future Improvements
Add CSS styling for better design and responsiveness.

Integrate JavaScript for interactivity (form validation, dynamic content).

Deploy the portfolio using GitHub Pages or Netlify for easy access.
